gitBookLog is a simple and slightly hackish program that can be used to turn a dump from git-log into a nice logbook

To use the program simply run the snippet in the comment at the top of main.py

Move the file created (probably) git-data.txt into the same directory and run main.py

Thats about it hopefully i will get around to improving the program and writing a more compleate README some time in the future
